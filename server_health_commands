1.Nginx:
Check the status of the Nginx service:
sudo systemctl status nginx

2.Gunicorn:
Since you set up Gunicorn as a systemd service, you can check its status similarly:
sudo systemctl status recyclebin

3.Logs:
It's often a good idea to check the logs if you're unsure about the health of your services:

For Nginx: sudo tail -n 20 /var/log/nginx/error.log

For Gunicorn (if you've set up logging in your systemd service file):
sudo tail -n 20 /path/to/your/gunicorn.log  # replace with the actual path if you set one

4.Visit Your Website:
Simply open a browser and navigate to your website. This is a practical test to see if Nginx and Gunicorn are serving your Django application correctly.

5.Server Resources:
While not directly related to Nginx or Gunicorn, it's often a good idea to check the server's resources. If the server is running low on resources, it can cause performance issues or crashes.

Check memory and CPU usage: top

Check disk space: df -h
